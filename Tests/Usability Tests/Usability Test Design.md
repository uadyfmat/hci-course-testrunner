## Description
This document includes the design that the testing team must follow for the application of the Usability Tests corresponding to the ***"Extension of the Test-Runner aimed at students"*** project. Likewise, the elements to be considered during its application are detailed. 

## Selection of Priority RNFs

The Non-Functional Requirements selected for the usability tests application are all those that have reached a **High Priority** level. It should be noted that the establishment of priority levels occurred through the identification of usability problems during the application of the Exploratory Tests. You can see the individual reports for each of the Exploratory Tests [here](../Exploratory%20Tests/Exploratory%20Tests%20Reports/).


The NFRs with a **High Priority** level are listed below: 

- [NFR 4: Test Scores](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#nfr-4)
- [NFR 5: User Operational Simplicity](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#nfr-5)
- [NFR 6: Simplicity in the User Interface](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#nfr-6)
- [NFR 7: Ease of Use](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#nfr-7)
- [NFR 8: Clarity of User Interfaces](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#nfr-8)

> **Note:** The [NFR 2: Ease of configuration](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#nfr-2) was discarded due to the problems presented by McCall in the reference included in the definition of the Quality Attribute [Understandability](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#understandability). Originally, this NFR had a High Priority level

Likewise, the Quality Attributes related to the NFR with High Priority are listed below:

- [Simplicity](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#simplicity)
- [Effectiveness](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#efficiency)
- [Satisfaction](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#satisfaction)
 

## Objectives of the Application of Usability Tests

The main objectives of doing the testing are:
- Obtain objective measurements on the state of key Quality Attributes related to the system.
- Determine if the users are comfortable with the UI proposed.
- Find possible opportunities of improvement.
 

## Usability Test Planning

Details related to the test design are mentioned below.

### Total Time Estimated for the Application

The total time allocated for the application of all iterations of the usability test is 1-3, corresponding to a "Just in-time" test. This period was determined from the scheduling of the activities corresponding to each test.

### Number of Test Subjects and Division of Test Sessions

The number of participants per testing session is estimated to range between one to three (1-3) participants. The test is designed to be able to accept one-on-one testing between a single Test Subject and the Testing Team, so the measurements are not affected by the number of participants present during each session.

The participation of 9 Test Subjects is planned, divided into 3 test sessions of 3 individuals each.

Additionally, a Preliminary Usability Test session is being reserved with the participation of a single Test Subject. This session should be executed prior to the application of the actual Usability Tests, in order to validate the correctness of the test protocol, the activities and scenarios covered and the timing of the test application, as well as to detect problems during the test procedure and to train the test team members on the test protocol itself. Any error or problem detected during the application of the Preliminary Usability Test shall be corrected by the Testing Team within three days after the date of the Preliminary Test.

### Test Subject Selection

In order for an individual to be eligible to participate in Usability Test Session they must have a user profile similar to the one detailed in [Student User Profile](../../User%20Analysis/User%20Modeling/Personas%20Profiles.md#jose---software-engineer-student). Additionally, listed below are the **mandatory traits** that test subject candidates must have in order to be eligible:

- Belong to or aspire to enter higher level computer-oriented careers, higher level careers that have Algorithm, Structured Programming, Object Oriented Programming or any subject that is based on code assignments.
- Have limited basic knowledge of algorithms and programming.

Likewise, the **desirable traits** that a candidate may have to be eligible are listed below:

- To belong to the first semesters of a computer oriented career.
- Basic knowledge of Visual Studio Code environment, or any other programming environment.
- To have basic knowledge in C, C++ or Python programming language.
- Have skills of continuous improvement, commitment, responsibility and motivation.

The Testing Team will be in charge of recruiting participants for the testing who have the desired User Profile.

### Test Scenarios

Once the objectives were assigned and the metrics were found, the next step was defining the application process to be used and the test scenarios to be carried out. You can see this procedure with more detail in the [Guide for the Application of Usability Tests](Guide%20for%20the%20Application%20of%20Usability%20Tests.md).

### Tools

The instruments and tools used for the application and data collection of the usability test are listed below:

- Figma (Software for designing and prototyping) 
- Maze (Software built for testing)
- Google Forms 
- Microsoft Excel 
- Microsoft Teams

The materials used for the application of the Usability Test are the following:

- Prototypes on Figma
- Maze test
- SUS Survey on Google Forms

## Usability Metrics

The Usability Metrics intended for measuring High Priority Quality Attributes are as follows:
- [Effectiveness Rate of Performing Tasks](../../Requirements/Metrics%20Related%20to%20Quality%20Attributes.md#effectiveness-rate-of-performing-tasks) (Target Quality Attribute: [Efficiency](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#efficiency))
- [Number of User Errors](../../Requirements/Metrics%20Related%20to%20Quality%20Attributes.md#number-of-user-errors) (Target Quality Attribute: [Efficiency](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#efficiency))
- [Interface Satisfaction Level](../../Requirements/Metrics%20Related%20to%20Quality%20Attributes.md#interface-satisfaction-level) (Target Quality Attribute: [Satisfaction](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#satisfaction))
- [Interface Simplicity Level](../../Requirements/Metrics%20Related%20to%20Quality%20Attributes.md#interface-simplicity-level) (Target Quality Attribute: [Simplicity](../../Requirements/Requirements%20Definition.md#simplicity))

The complete information on each metric can be found in the [Metrics Related to Quality Attributes](../../Requirements/Metrics%20Related%20to%20Quality%20Attributes.md) document.
