## Description
This section is intended to specify the functional requirements of the system to be developed during the period January-May 2024. In previous phases of the project, it was determined that the way to mitigate the usability problems present in the *Test-Runner* system and its currently established form of use, is through an extension of Visual Studio Code, which allows users to use the tool locally. 

## Abbreviations

**Description:** The system should be able to detect the user's OS without the user having to specify it, in order to install dependencies and configure environment variables. 

**Priority:** Low

**Conditions:** This requirement arises from [Functional Requirement 2](#fr-2) and [Functional Requirement 3](#fr-3), and from [Non-Functional Requirement 1](#nfr-1). The validity of this requirement is determined by the requirements mentioned above.

>  **Note:** For understanding the user interaction with this requirement, see the *Normal Flow* and *Alternative Flow* sections for the [FR2](#fr-2) or [FR3](#fr-3).

**Priority:** Low

**Conditions:** The user will choose whether to install the dependencies of their choice or not to install anything additional.

> **Note:** This requirement depends on [RF1](#fr-1).

**Normal Flow:** 

1. The user installs the extension.

2. The user specifies the dependencies to install.

3. The system automatically detects your OS (Depending on the OS, a specific dependency manager is used).

4. The system installs the specified dependencies.

**Alternative Flow:** 

1. The user has previously installed the required dependencies.

2. The user installs the extension.

3. The user omits the installation of dependencies through the extension.

**Conditions:** the user has previously selected the desired dependencies for installation through the system.

> **Note:** This requirement depends on [RF1](#fr-1) and [RF2](#fr-2).

**Normal Flow:** 

1. The system automatically detects your OS.

2. The system installs the specified dependencies.

3. The system adds the dependencies installation paths to the OS environment variables.

> **Note:** Depending of the OS, the command to add installation paths to the environment variables changes.

**Alternative Flow:** 

1. The user omits the installation of dependencies through the extension.

3. The validation determines that there are no previous installations of the tool.

4. The system installs the Test-Runner tool.

**Alternative Flow:** 

1. The user selects the option to install the Test-Runner tool.

2. The system validates if a Test-Runner installation is already installed on the system.

3. The validation determines that the Test-Runner tool is already installed on the system.
